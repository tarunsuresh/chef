Shakshouka meets crispy hash browns! This Parsi-Indian version of Shakshouka is serious comfort food with it’s soft poached eggs nestled in spicy tomato sauce, on a bed of crispy potato sticks. It makes one of the best breakfast/ brunch dish or an even better breakfast for dinner meal!

Shakshouka (or Shakshuka) is all the rage these days.  Roughly translating to “all mixed up” in Arabic, Shakshouka originally came from North- African countries like Tunisia, but was widely adopted by Israeli cuisine. It is essentially a stove top dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, onions and peppers that packs a lot of flavor with it’s mix of middle eastern spices. Served with Pita or Challah to sop up the oozing egg yolk and spicy tomato goodness, this dish is serious comfort food and it transcends traditional mealtime boundaries. It something that can be enjoyed be it breakfast, brunch, dinner or any time in between.

Turkey has it’s own version of Shakshouka called ‘Menemen’ and it’s not to far off of the Latin American “Huevos ranceros’ breakfast dish. The Parsi community in India, who were originally from Persia/Iran have their own version of this dish called “Sali Par Edu/Eda” which literally translates to Eggs on (‘par Edu’) fried potato sticks (‘Sali’). It was probably adopted from their Israeli neighbors, as it closely resembles  Shakshuka with one added bonus, it includes a bed of crispy poatato straws/sticks also known as shoestring potatoes.
